# Integrating Third-Party Apps

Integrating third-party apps allows you to pass readily authenticated apps to your Action handlers.

Third-party apps can be connected either globally as an admin or individually per user.

We get started with admin app integrations and will look at user-connected apps in a later chapter.

## Adding an Integration as Admin

Let's connect Trello to our previously created app.

``` bash
bitmio projects myapp integrations create trello
```

Follow the auth instructions in the returned URL to complete the setup.

## List integrated Apps

You can view the status of integrated apps.

``` bash
bitmio projects myapp integrations
```

## Explore supported App Integrations

For a list of all supported App Integrations:
