# Inviting App Users

Having defined our first Action we can go ahead and invite some users to our app.

## Creating App Signup Links

To enable signup we simply need to create our signup link:

``` bash
bitmio projects myapp signup-links create
```

By default new signups join are assigned the User role - we can override this for our link:

``` bash
bitmio projects myapp signup-links create --role admin
```

### List Signup Links

We can always list our existing signup links:

``` bash
bitmio projects myapp signup-links list
```

### Disable Signup Links

To disable existing links:

``` bash
bitmio projects myapp signup-links delete YOUR_SIGNUP_LINK
```

## Creating one-time invites

We can also create one-time invites that only allow a single signup:

``` bash
bitmio projects myapp invite-links create
```

We can optionally pass a name and/or email the link will get sent to:

``` bash
bitmio projects myapp invite-links create --name "Ann" --email "ann@example.com"
```

Again we can override the default User role in the invite:

``` bash
bitmio projects myapp invite-links create --name "Ann" --email "ann@example.com" --role admin
```

## Existing User Authentication

Existing users of your app can authenticate via the CLI:

``` bash
bitmio myapp login
```

And follow the login instructions in the returned URL.
