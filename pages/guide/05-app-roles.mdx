# Creating App User Roles

You can skip this chapter if your app doesn't need to support advanced roles.

By default every app defines an `owner` and `user` role.
Owners have access to app usage metrics, billing and advanced user management.
Users are only able to run Actions and invite other users.
We can configure these permissions and even define entirely new roles.

## Creating custom Roles

Let's create a custom support role that we want to grant limited access to Actions later:

``` bash
bitmio projects myapp roles create support --name "Support"
```

## Updating a User's Roles
To change an existing user's role:

``` bash
bitmio projects myapp users USER_ID set-role support
```

## Limit Action access to Roles

By default our new role has no access to any Actions.

Let's grant them access to our previously defined Trello Search action.

``` bash
bitmio projects myapp actions search_trello add-role support
```

We can view all roles permitted to run an action in the action details:

``` bash
bitmio projects myapp actions search_trello
```
