# Bitmio CLI Authentication

## Authenticate via browser

``` bash
bitmio login
```

Open the returned URL and follow the sign in instructions.

After successful browser login you will be asked to paste your access token into the CLI prompt.

## Authenticate via API key

Add `BITMIO_API_KEY` to your environment variables to authenticate.

Or authenticate via the CLI:

``` bash
bitmio auth YOUR_API_KEY
```

To create a new API key with an optional name:

``` bash
bitmio api-keys create [name]
```

You can also list existing API keys:

``` bash
bitmio api-keys list
```

And delete an API key by name:

``` bash
bitmio api-keys delete [name]
```

Next we will create our first app and invite team members.
