# Creating Actions

Your App's Actions will be available via a REST API, the Bitmio SDKs and the CLI.

You define the Action input types a handler webhook and optionally the response type.

## Creating an Action

We create a simple action that is supposed to respond with a list of Trello cards based on a search input.

``` bash
bitmio projects myapp actions create search_trello
```

This immediately gives you instructions on how to invoke the new Action.

It hasn't been configured yet so invoking it will only return an error.

## Configure the Action handler

To handle an Action you have to supply a webhook URL to which your App delegates all requests.

``` bash
bitmio projects myapp actions search_trello set-webhook YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL
```

If you invoke your Action now it will forward the webhook response.

## Testing an Action

We test our Action by passing it a `search` property which our webhook hopefully handles correctly:

``` bash
bitmio projects myapp actions search_trello run --search "My Card"
```

Note that this is not the way our App user will invoke the Action - more on that later but it will look a lot simpler:

``` bash
bitmio myapp search_trello --search "My Card"
```

## Defining the Action Input

We can pass arbitrary properties to our Action - typing the input is optional.

By defining our input types we can automatically generate API docs and validate input.

``` bash
bitmio projects myapp actions search_trello set-input \
  --field search --type string --name "Search" \
  --field max_age --type int? --name "Maximum Age"
```

This defines two input properties:

- A field with ID `search` of type `string` with a human readable name of "Search".
- A field with ID `max_age` as an optional `int?` with a name of "Maximum Age"

## Passing App Integrations as input

To relieve our action handler from having to store the Trello authentication, we can pass the previously created Trello auth:

``` bash
bitmio projects myapp actions search_trello set-input \
  --field trello --type trello_auth --value integrations.trello
```

Or to pass in our second Trello integration previously connected:

``` bash
bitmio projects myapp actions search_trello set-input \
  --field trello --type trello_auth --value integrations.my_other_trello
```

The correct identifiers for the integrations can be retrieved with:

``` bash
bitmio projects myapp integrations
```

The action handler webhook will receive the access tokens of the passed app integrations along with the other fields.

We omitting the `--value` option we can ask the app user to provider their own Trello connection:

``` bash
bitmio projects myapp actions search_trello set-input \
  --field trello --type trello_auth
```

### Updating Input Field Types

If we wanted change the name of an existing field:

``` bash
bitmio projects myapp actions search_trello set-input \
  --field max_age --name "Max. Age"
```

### Deleting Input Fields

If we wanted to delete existing fields:

``` bash
bitmio projects myapp actions search_trello set-input \
  --field max_age --delete
```

## Defining the Action Output

Analog to the input we can type the Action output.

Let's add some type definitions for our `search_trello` action.

``` bash
bitmio projects myapp actions search_trello set-output \
  --field items --type [] --name "Trello Search Results"
```

This tells our Action to expect a list of items in property `items`.

### Creating Custom Types

We want to specify this further and describe the type of items returned.

For this we need to create a custom Type first:

``` bash
bitmio projects myapp types create trello_card \
  --name "Trello Card"
  --field title --type string --name "Title"
  --field description --type long_text --name "Description"
  --field due_date --type date? --name "Due Date"
```

Which tells Bitmio about our custom Trello Card type with ID `trello_card`.

We can now update our Action output type:

``` bash
bitmio projects myapp actions search_trello set-output \
  --field items --type [trello_card]
```

Bitmio will now warn us whenever the returned output does not match the type definition.
