# Getting Started

Walk through setting up your own App with custom Actions, third-party app integrations, user signup and usage monitoring.

## Install the Bitmio CLI

``` bash
npm install -g bitmio-cli
```

For a list of all supported commands run help:

``` bash
bitmio help
```

In the next step we will create a Bitmio account if needed and authenticate our CLI.
